This site was made as a landing page for people who are interested in games that "my company" has published. 
The index gives a breif description and history of the company and serves as a "landing page." It includes hyperlinks to the contact us/ about us section and the games section.
The contact us/ about us page lets the user know the staff and their positions in the company, it also allows them to send a quick comment.
The games page shows the user the games that "my company" has published, a description of each game and a hyperlink to the games' website.

These games weren't made by me and I don't own a company: images were taken from hiclipart.com, pngegg.com, pngitem.com and belongs to the owners and actual publishers of the game.
